Challenge#3
=====  
We have a nested object, we would like a function that you pass in the object and a key and get back the value

## What it does
- I have created a script that accepts the object and key as an input value and return the value assiciated with the key. 

## How to install
- [Create an EC2 Linux instance on AWS](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/EC2_GetStarted.html)
- [SSH into the instance](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/AccessingInstancesLinux.html)
- Install jq on your instance 
    - `sudo yum install jq -y`
- Clone this repository
  - `git clone https://github.com/clouddevops3/TechRepository`

## How to run
- Open the `Challenge#3` directory
  - `cd Challenge#3`
  - Run sh ./objectkey.sh and it will ask for object and key, please provide the same to see the output.
